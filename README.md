## Overview

Things is a collection of random trinkets, items and features that I feel enhance the Vanilla experience in a non-instrusive way. Among its features are the 
*Enchanted Wax Gland* which lets you travel very quickly in water, the *Displacement Tome* which is essentially a Warp Book remake, the *Bater Wucket* which is an
infinite Water Bucket and many more
